<h1>Alien Bloc</h1>
This is a experimental rock themed menu created using a custom polygon tool called Anchors.
It is intended to be a interesting front page for a rock climbing gym.

See it in action at with hover animations at: https://alien-bloc.vercel.app

This does use abit of a scruffed light engine I created to interact with images cropped by svg polygons.
